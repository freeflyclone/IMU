### i2ctest
STM32F429-Nucleo144 project to develop I2C expertise on STMicrodevices and tools

Learning a new uC always involves getting a hardware dev board, setting up a 
development environment, writing some code to blink an LED.

In this case, I need to get cozy with STM32 products, and the usual serial I/O goodies.
I'm starting with I2C, which I'll use to talk to an [Adafruit 10 DOF IMU](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1604) sensor board.
